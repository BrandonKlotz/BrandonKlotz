Hey 👋, I’m a product engineer who loves shipping value early and often. I work mostly with Rails and React, and I use AI to help speed things up and spark new ideas. I’m also a creative developer at heart—I dive into design, illustration, writing, and 3D to bring imaginative ideas to life with a sense of craft and play. I tinker with AI tools, game dev, and anything that feels fun to build. Outside of work, I’m usually out mountain biking, paddle boarding, or playing flag football 🏈
