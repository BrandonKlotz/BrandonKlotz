Hey there, it's great to meet you! I'm Brandon, a multilingual entrepreneur with a passion for all things creative. Whether it's technology, design, fashion, art, or storytelling, I love to dive in and explore new ways of bringing ideas to life.

With a playful energy and a positive attitude, I always aim to create something unique and inspiring. For me, work should be fun and engaging, and I love to infuse that sense of joy into everything I do.

So, if you're looking for a versatile and enthusiastic partner to collaborate with, I'm your guy! Let's join forces and create something truly magical together.

Oh and I'm all about Rails and getting people onboard to ship valuable things to humans.
